# Circumferenceinnator
This program classifies two circumferences according to their relative positions.
This program depends on Kip Irvine's Irvine32 assembly library. Please download the dependencies before running the program.

Explanation:

Enter 2 centers and 2 radius, the program classifies the circunferences corresponding to such values according to their relative postions, i.e:
1. Internal tangent circunferences: one is inside the other and they have a single intersection point.
2. External tangent circunferences: they have a single intersenction point. The distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.
3. External circunferences: they don't intersect and the distance between their centers is greater than the sum of their radii.
4. Internal circunferences: one is inside the other and they don't share any common point.
5. Internal concentric circunferences: one is inside the other and they share the same center.
6. Secant circunferences: they intersect at two points.

The program also calculates the intersection points in the cases where they exist.
